Critter Rings
=================================

![Header image](docs/image.png)

This incredibly self-indulgent mod has five rings in it: the Butterfly Ring, the Bunny Ring, the Frog Ring, the Owl Ring, and the Firefly Ring. Each summons the relevant critter when worn. Additionally, each has extra secondary effect.
